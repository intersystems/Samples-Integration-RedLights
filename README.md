# Samples-Integration-RedLights
This repository contains sample red light violation data and the scripts to load it into your InterSystems IRIS instance. It is used in the [Building a Basic Integration in InterSystems IRIS](https://learning.intersystems.com/course/view.php?name=SmartTicketingSystem) exercise.

The main goal is to show the benefits of integration within InterSystems IRIS Data Platform such as business orchestration, record mapper, data transformations.
